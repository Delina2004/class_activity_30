# TextBox Class

## Overview

The `TextBox` class is a simple C++ implementation that encapsulates the functionality of a text box. It allows users to create text boxes, set their content, and display the content to the console. The code demonstrates foundational C++ concepts, including class definitions, constructors, encapsulation, and method usage.

---

## Features

- **Default Constructor**: Initializes the text box with an empty string.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Allows initialization with a custom string value.
- **Getter Method**: Retrieves the current value stored in the text box.
- **Setter Method**: Updates the value stored in the text box.
- **Display Method**: Outputs the current value of the text box to the console.

## File Structure

The project consists of three files:

1. **Header File (`TextBox.hpp`)**
   - Contains the declaration of the `TextBox` class and its methods.

2. **Implementation File (`TextBox.cpp`)**
   - Implements the methods defined in the header file.

3. **Main File (`main.cpp`)**
   - Demonstrates the usage of the `TextBox` class through examples.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler
